## Fill whole screen

to use all the available space for IOs Safari use position fixed

## Layout

- flexbox and 100% height
- scrolling area with flexbox and height: 0

## disable pinch zoom

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, user-scalable=no" />
```

not workin, fixed with:

```css
* {
  touch-action: pan-x pan-y;
}
```

can a user zoom out? - no

ios safari will zoom in if a user focuses on a text input where the font size is less than 16px

```css
* {
  -webkit-text-size-adjust: none;
  text-size-adjust: none;
}
```

with this the browser wont zoom when user focuses on textfields. dont know of any other "auto-zoom" events
`maximum-scale=1` in the meta tag might help too
